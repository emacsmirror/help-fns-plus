  "Return non-nil if VARIABLE satisfies one of the custom types in TYPES.
TYPES is a list of `defcustom' type sexps or a list of regexp strings.
TYPES are matched, in order, against VARIABLE's type definition or
VARIABLE's current value, until one is satisfied or all are tried.

If TYPES is a list of regexps, then each is regexp-matched against
VARIABLE's custom type.

Otherwise, TYPES is a list of type sexps, each of which is a
definition acceptable for `defcustom' :type or the first symbol of
such a definition (e.g. `choice').  In this case, two kinds of type
comparison are possible:

1. VARIABLE's custom type, or its first symbol, is matched using
  `equal' against each type in TYPES.

2. VARIABLE's current value is checked against each type in TYPES to
   see if it satisfies one of them.  In this case, VARIABLE's own type
   is not used; VARIABLE might not even be typed - it could be a
   variable not defined using `defcustom'.

For any of the comparisons against VARIABLE's type, either that type
can be checked directly or its supertypes (inherited types) can also
be checked.

These different type-checking possibilities depend on the value of
argument MODE, as follows, and they determine the meaning of the
returned value:

`direct':   VARIABLE's type matches a member of list TYPES
`inherit':  VARIABLE's type matches or is a subtype of a TYPES member
`value':    VARIABLE is bound, and its value satisfies a type in TYPES
`inherit-or-value': `inherit' or `value', tested in that order
`direct-or-value':  `direct' or `value', tested in that order
anything else (default): `inherit'

impossible to know which concrete types a value must match."
